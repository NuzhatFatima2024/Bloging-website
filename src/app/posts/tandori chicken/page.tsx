          1. Ingredients
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
        
        Chicken: Typically, bone-in chicken pieces (like thighs and drumsticks) are used, as they remain juicy and tender during cooking.

Marinade: The chicken is marinated in a mixture that usually includes:

Yogurt: Acts as a tenderizer and helps the spices adhere to the chicken.
Spices: A blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and red chili powder.
Aromatics: Ginger and garlic paste add depth of flavor.
Citrus: Lemon or lime juice adds acidity, enhancing flavor and tenderness.
Food Coloring: Sometimes used to give the chicken its characteristic reddish hue, although it's optional.

          2. Cooking Method
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify leading-7 mb-6">
        Marination: The chicken is marinated for several hours, ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

Tandoor Cooking:

The marinated chicken is skewered and placed in a tandoor, where it cooks at high temperatures.
The intense heat cooks the chicken quickly, resulting in a smoky flavor and charred exterior while keeping the meat juicy inside.
Oven or Grill Alternative: If a tandoor is not available, the chicken can be cooked in an oven or on a grill. The chicken can be placed on a baking tray or a grill pan, and broiling can be used to achieve a similar effect.
